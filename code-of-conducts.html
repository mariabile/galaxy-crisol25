											<p>We aim to create an environment where people can build new collaborations, present ideas, 
											start new projects, and in general perform research in an ethically-sound manner. We value the 
											participation of each member and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. 
											Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to others throughout the workshop, 
											and share our commitment to create a safe environment that values diversity and inclusion and therefore 
											is free from harassment. All attendees and organizers are required to conform to the following 
											Code of Conduct, which the Organizing Committee will enforce throughout the event.</p>

											<!-- <ol type="i"> -->
												<li>The Organizing Committee considers harassment to include offensive comments, gestures and behaviour 
													related to sex, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, marital or parental status, age, 
													disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate 
													intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or 
													other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome intrusions of personal space or sexual attention. 
													Conduct can be harassment even if it was not intended to violate the recipient's dignity, if it had that effect. 
													A single incident may amount to harassment if it is sufficiently serious. Conduct normally becomes harassment 
													if it persists once it has been made clear that the behaviour is regarded as offensive. Participants asked to stop 
													any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.</li>
												<li>Please be aware that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Offensive jokes 
													and excessive swearing will not be tolerated in this workshop. If a participant engages in behaviour that 
													violates this Code of Conduct, the Organizing Committee may take any action they deem appropriate, 
													from warning the offender up to expulsion from the meeting.</li>
												<li>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact 
													a member of the Organizing Committee. More information on how to deal with incidents can be found in the section below.</li>
												<li>Please make sure that you have explicit speaker's permission if you wish to share photos 
													or videos of the speaker on social media.</li>
											<!-- </ol> -->

											<h3>ATTENDEE PROCEDURE FOR INCIDENT HANDLING</h3>
											<p>If you experience or witness behaviour that breaches this Code of Conduct, we strongly recommend 
												reporting it to the Organizing Committee as soon as possible. Resolving issues early and informally 
												is usually preferable for everyone concerned. Often, people are unaware that their behaviour is 
												perceived as harassment, discrimination or bullying, and in these cases taking prompt informal 
												action can be particularly effective.
											</p>

											<p>Report any harassment incident (preferably in writing) to a member of the Organizing Committee. 
												Please do not disclose public information about the incident until the Organizing Committee has 
												had sufficient time in which to address the situation. This is for the safety and protection of 
												those affected. When reporting the event, try to recall as much information as possible about the incident.
											</p>

											<p>Note: Incidents that violate the Code of Conduct are extremely damaging to the community, and they will 
												not be tolerated. The Organizing Committee requests that they be your first resource when reporting an incident, 
												so that they may enforce the Code of Conduct and take quick action toward a resolution. Awareness and reporting 
												of these incidents present a chance for the offenders, and the community at large, to grow, learn, and become better.
											</p>
